  For my MVP, I created a version 1 of my final water turret based out of a 5-gallon water bucket. The turret uses two servos controlled
  by my Arduino ESP32 to rotate and tilt a water nozzle. The water nozzle is connected to a water pump I found in the lab. Thw pump
  is powered directly from the wall via an outlet, while the servos and microcontroller are powered by my computer which is how I control
  them in real time. On my computer, I type into the serial monitor phrases like "X100" to move the horizontal servo to 100 degrees, 
  or "Y45" to move the vertical servo to 45 degrees.

  <br></br>
  Iteration:
  <br></br>
  I initially 3D printed a 5mm nozzle (first picture below) to guage the power of the water pump and was left unsatisfied. The pump 
  produced a weak stream of water that would not be effective for my final project, so I halved the diameter to 2.5mm (shown mounted 
  on the servo assembly) and achieved a slightly stronger stream.

  <br></br>
  Designing the servo mounts was challenging, I opted for a direct-mount system that utilized the existing holes on the sevro horns. 
  See the pictures below of my assembly.

  Additionally, I struggled with the assembly housing for the servos. My first design had no mounting ability and the dimensions 
  exceeded the size of my bucket. I redesigned the assembly to have ring matching the top of my bucket with evenly spaced mounting 
  holes. This allowed me to securely fasten the assembly to the bucket and ensure stability when the servos moved. After test-fitting
  I even added a plastic bag hot glued to the bottom of the assembly to prevent water from splashing into the servos.

  Oscilloscope Reading:
  <br></br>

  Below are my readings and mappings for the servo signals which I read using the oscilloscope in the lab. I found that the servos 
  operated between 0.5ms and 2.4ms pulse widths, with 1.45ms being the center position. I mapped these values in my code to correspond
  to angles between 0 and 180 degrees.
