<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Automatic Drink Refiller</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Have you ever finished your cup of water or prefered beverage while sitting at the dinner table? 
Well those days will be over soon with my amazing Automatic Drink Refiller! 
Utilizing computer vision, an algorithm will locate your cup on the table when its' capacity is below 20%,
signaling a water cannon to shoot a remarkable parabola of water overhead and into your cup until it is full once again.

<h4>Idea 2: Playing Card Sorter</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Taking inspiration from a cash counting machine, this project will be able to sort a shuffled deck of playing cards 
into their respective suits and order. Using a camera and computer vision, the machine will be able to identify each 
card as it is fed into the machine. Then, using a series of servos and motors, the cards will be sorted into their 
respective suits and order (or alternatively, custom sorted to "rig" a game in the user's favor)

<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 3: Large Heat-Activated Display</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Take an image and uploade it to this iterface. The image will be processed and converted into a low-resolution, 4 color
version of the original image. This new image will then be presented onto a heat-sensitive canvas using a serise of 
underlying heating and cooling tiles.
