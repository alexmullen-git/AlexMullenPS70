<h3>Week 8: CNC Milling</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h4>

  This week I took on an ambitiously large project of building a CNC milled table. I started by designing the table in Fusion, 
  making two artistic legs with tabs to fit into the table top. I then realized that the stock and design I wanted to use were 
  too large for the CNC machine we have to cut all at once, so I shortened the legs of the table and separated the cutting jobs. 
  After much back and forth with the toolpaths and understanding the limitations of the CNC, I was able to successfully cut out all 
  the parts. I cut the legs first from 12mm plywood then made sure the real dimensions fit my design. Each leg features custom 
  designs on the side that utilize interior and exterior toolpaths with 4mm cut depth. After that, I realized that the stock we had 
  was not sifficient for the size and design of the table top I wanted, so I cut some of the unmanagable sized supply stock into 
  smaller pieces and cut out my table top leaving more material for my peers. I then sanded all the pieces down, giving them a 
  smooth finish. Finally, with the convincing power of a hammer, I assembled the table by fitting the leg ssnugly into the table top.
  Overall, I am very satisfied with the final product- it's going to be a great addition to my dorm room!

<h4>Assignment 2: Mold/Cast/Vacuum Form Product</h4>

  Have you ever watched 5-minute crafts? They always make these cool random projects with hot glue. That has always captivated 
  my interest, so I decided to take inspiration from them. Initially I 3D printed a fidget spinner and then used the vacuum former 
  to create a perfect mold. It was at this critical moment that I realized the inconvenience of resin and how long it would take to 
  cure. So instead I remembered how 5-minute crafts uses hot glue for everything, so I decided to use hot glue to create the fidget 
  spinner. I lined the mold with vegetable oil to fascilate mold release and then filled the mold with the coolest temperature of hot 
  glue I could manage. After letting it cool for a few minutes I popped it out of the mold and was shocked by the resulting 
  flexibility. The vacuum formed mold did deform from the heat of the glue and the oil seemed to impact the glue's properties, but 
  overall I was very satisfied with the final product.
