  Have you every had the awkward experience of waving to someone and they just didn't see you? Well I created a solution
  to that problem with an ESP32-controlled waving hand! This project uses a servo motor and potentiometer to wave a hand back 
  and forth based on the user's input. You can be control how dramatic the wave is by turning the potentiometer; the hand will
  match your movements!

  Coding this project was challenging for me since I spent a day trying to troubleshoot my code while I simply had a dead servo.
  Once I replaced the servo, I was able to get my code working smoothly and broke it down into simpler segments as seen above.
  The cardboard cutouts were laser-cut and I used hot glue to assemble all the pieces toegther. I also used soldering to attach
  wires to the potentiometer and then connect them to the breadboard. In the end, I am happy how this project turned out,
  exposing me to the possibilities and simplicity of microcontroller programming. See the final project gif below!
