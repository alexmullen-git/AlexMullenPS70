<h3>Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting</h3>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>Assignment 1: Make a Box</h4>

<br></br>
  I designed a box so amazing, some may even consider it contemporary art. This box was made from 7mm Cardboard
  and was designed in Fusion 360, a new software for me. I used the extrude and sketch tools to create the shapes
  and the dimensions are 300mm x 200mm x 200mm. The open-top design is perfect for storing all of my components, 
  allowing me to store objects of all sizes, even really long dowels.

<h4>Assignment 2: Fusion 360 Tutorial</h4>

<br></br>
  I designed a screw and nut in Fusion in order to explore modeling complementary parts.

<h4>Assignment 3: Fusion Modeling</h4>

<br></br>
  When deciding what to model, I thought long and hard about what would be the hardest object ever and landed on..... a role of tape.
  My measurements were so detailed and enabled me to perfectly recreate the tape roll in Fusion. As my first time free-handing CAD 
  in Fusion, this remarkably complex model took me about 70 minutes to complete.

<br></br>
  As a second model, I thought longer and harder until stumbling upon the idea of modeling a light switch. This model was much more 
  difficult than the tape roll since I used the fillet tool and had to model features on different axes and heights. With more 
  experience now, I am happy to report that this model took me no longer than 60 minutes.
